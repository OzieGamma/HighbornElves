This is an alternative army book for the Highborn Elves for the 9th age project (http://the-ninth-age.com).

**It is not meant to be used in competitive play.** It is meant as a basis to create the next official release of the Highborn Elves army book.

Differences with the official version:
- Added Drake knights, Lion Knights and Wild Lions as units.
- Changed the honours system to a realm based system.
- Changed magic items and army-wide special rules.

**Note**:
- I don't think we need both Wild Lions and Lion Knights. I just didn't know which unit to add.
